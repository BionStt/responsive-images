# responsive-images

This sample project helps me understand img tag's srcset and sizes attributes.

## Follow these steps to get started

1. Launch index.html with FireFox (Chrome has a caching issue by design).
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+M to open Responsive Design Mode.
3. Drag the bottom right corner to resize the displayed area to be

    * below 400px
    * between 400px and 800px
    * between 800px and 1200px
    * greater than 1200px

4. Then try change DPR (1,2,3) while adjusting area to above listed sizes.
5. Finally try click on Responsive dropdown to test different devices from phones, tablets to laptops.
